Welcome! Iâ€™m a second year PhD Student in Computer Science at the [University of St. Gallen](https://unisg.ch) in Switzerland in the lab for [Interactions- and Communication-based Systems](https://interactions.ics.unisg.ch). 

My research explores *Personalized Reality* as a concept for *Personalization* in physical reality. I'm interested in developing systems and prototypes using the technologies needed to make this vision a reality, like *Mixed Reality* or *Ubiquitous Computing*. Additionally, I'm studying the potential social impact of such truly ubiquitous personalization. Read more about my research [here](./research).

My work-related interests:
- Mixed Reality
- Ubiquitous Computing
- Personalization
- Privacy
- Internet of Things
- Computer Vision
- Technology Acceptance
