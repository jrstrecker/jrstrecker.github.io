Welcome! 


Hi, my name is Jannis and I’m a second year PhD Student in Computer Science at the [University of St. Gallen](https://unisg.ch) in Switzerland in the lab for [Interactions- and Communication-based Systems](https://interactions.ics.unisg.ch). 

In my research, investigate how personalization as we know it from the Web, might look like if we bring this to physical reality (or the physical world around us) through **Mixed Reality** or **Ubiquitous Computing**. We call the result of this a **Personalized Reality**. 
During the course of my dissertation, I want to research what the necessary technological components are to make this a reality, and the social impact this might have on people. Here, I especially want to investigate  ways to mitigate potential harms of personalization like filter bubbles or loss of user agency, while strengthening benefits like better decision making or increased efficiency for users. 

To illustrate what a Personalized Reality could be like, let me give you some examples. You probably know personalized services like Netflix or Amazon that show you personalized recommendations on their websites based on what you watched or bought before. Now, imagine that in the future you can have similar recommendation but in the physical world. For example, in the supermarket your AR glasses might highlight products that are better for your current diet,  or a public map that adapts its content based on what you might find interesting when you are standing in front of it, or you might perceive the world around you like you’re in your favourite movie.
