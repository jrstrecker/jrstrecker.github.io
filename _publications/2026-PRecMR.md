abstract: 'Board games often involve strategic decision making and procedural planning tasks. Such tasks require learners to make decisions based on dynamically evolving game state and changing information that is situated in a physical environment. Recommender systems can filter available information and provide learners with personalized and actionable suggestions that simplify their decision making while playing board games. Such recommendations can further be spatially aligned with relevant physical elements through Mixed Reality (MR). We present an MR system called GLAMRec for an engine-building strategy board game. GLAMRec provides personalized, transparent recommendations by integrating user data, real-time game state tracking, and ontology-based reasoning during a complex board game, which we use as a proxy environment for procedural learning tasks. We interviewed six board game designers to improve the GLAMRec and conducted a within-subjects design user study (N=32) to investigate how personalized explanations affect explanation satisfaction, user experience, and trust. We found that personalized recommendations significantly improve explanation satisfaction and hedonic user experience without affecting trust ratings, recommendation compliance, and game performance. These findings suggest that personalization primarily shaped perception of enjoyment rather than measurable learning outcomes or trust.'
