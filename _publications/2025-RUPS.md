abstract: 'Personalization of online realities is today ubiquitous to support decision making or reduce information overload. Recently, through the expanding capabilities and pervasiveness of Mixed Reality and Ubiquitous Computing technologies, we observe increasing personalization also of physical reality. This might yield more convenient, efficient and inclusive everyday interactions. However, it may readily lead to serious societal consequences such as the loss of shared worlds and the emergence of perceptual filter bubbles. To mitigate such harms while retaining the benefits of personalization, it is important to understand how ubiquitous personalization systems may operate responsibly. Responding to this need, we propose a conceptual model that overcomes the limitations of established personalization models and expands their applicable scope to physical, virtual, and hybrid environments. We validated our model in relation to existing literature and show how it provides a conceptual foundation for the analysis and study of responsible personalization systems that create individually and societally beneficial Personalized Realities.'
