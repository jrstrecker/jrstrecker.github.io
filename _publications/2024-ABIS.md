abstract: "ABIS is an international workshop, organized by the SIG on Adaptivity and User Modeling in Interactive Software Systems of the German Gesellschaft für Informatik. For more than 25 years, the ABIS Workshop has been a highly interactive forum for discussing the state of the art in personalization, user modeling, and related areas. ABIS 2024’s focus will be on the topics of personalization and recommendation within the areas of Computer-Supported Cooperative Work (CSCW) (i.e., support of individuals who work organized in groups), Cross-Reality (XR) Interaction (e.g., transitions inside the reality-virtuality continuum), and/or making sense of sensory data for personalization purposes. To discuss such questions, our workshop aims to bring together researchers and practitioners who are interested in the general personalization domain, and/or in our SIG’s current focus. Our goal is to identify current issues and future directions of research and foster future development of the discipline and collaborations."
